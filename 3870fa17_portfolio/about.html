                <h2>Hi, I am Elena!</h2>
                <p class="mobile"> Welcome to my Portfolio website. I live in the Bay area, and recently I am a student at the California State University, East Bay. I am on the road of my journey of studying Graphic Design.  Graphic design is my passion, and I so enjoy of what I do. I work with different media, and I am proficient with Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I believe that graphic design is a power that gives an excellent opportunity to attract people's attention. My goal is to create innovative, great-looking products that my clients will love. When I work on projects, at first I think about my clients' satisfaction.  I work with my clients to benefit them.
