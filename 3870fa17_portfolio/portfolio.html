              <p> Goal: Create a  four panel calendar, using any theme and objects that support the theme.</p>
              <p> I chose sweets to be the theme for a calendar for the 2017 year. My goal was to make the calendar cheerful, pleasant for view and have fun by experimenting with Photoshop. I decided to make the different associations with sweets according to each season. I classified sweets in four categories depending on their color, shapes, and frequency of sweets' consumption during the year. </p>

              <h6> About the project: </h6>
              <p> Goal: Using my three initials, I created my personal logo. This self-portrait represents my personality and determines who I am today.</p>
              <p> The letter E is the first letter of my first name. I made it the biggest in the self-portrait. It is because I see myself as an independent individual. I chose Edwardian Script font to show my individuality. I am delicate, easygoing and unique. I cut the part of the letter because I like to be different from others. I like to look out the box. The letter A is the first letter of my middle name. The letter comes after my father. I used the upper case to underline my respect to him. I flipped over f, which represents my last name, to emphasize the support that gives me my family.  I put f into intersection line of E to connect all tree letters. F connects to E and A inside E. All of them are connected, my personality is the result of mixture of my first, last and middle name.</p>

              <p> Goal: Create a cover page for the brochure about Tibor Kalman showcasing the style of the subject. </p>
              <p> My chose of style, colors and arrangement of contents were influenced by Kalman’s works. His perspective was communicated through bold graphic design, typography, and juxtaposition of photographs and doctored images. Creating a cover page I was influenced by Tibor’s work, Talking Heads album, that featured four digitally manipulated photographs of the group members and a title with upside-down letters. I repeated his style and modified his photo. I used a color picker to use the same colors (blue and red) as Tibor used by creating the Talking Heads album cover. The Controversial Possibilities of Graphics I chose to be my title. I wanted to acknowledge Kalman's contribution to the exploring of the possibilities of graphic design</p>
